# Tic Tac Toe

### Specification
Now that you’ve got the main foundations down to build out a frontend application, it’s time to prove to yourself that you own those skills! You’re going to be building a Tic Tac Toe game from scratch!

### Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- localStorage to persist data
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Solo Project Expectations
This project is an important step in demonstrating you are ready to start Module 2. To ensure we can accurately assess that, it’s important you meet the expectations:

- You are the only one who should type code - no copy-pasting code!
- For any code that you didn’t write entirely by yourself (mentor or rock supported), you should be able delete it and re-write it yourself
- No youtube videos or tutorials of programming Tic Tac Toe. If you have an opportunity and are tempted, do the right thing for YOUR learning and don’t do it!
- Any peer-to-peer collaboration should be discussions about IDEAS, not coding together or sharing code.
- We want to see YOUR work.
